                <h1>Favorite Movies</h1>
                <article>
                    Movies have always been a big part of my life. Yes, the convienence of streaming films of any era makes it easy to see anything anytime, but there's nothing that beats seeing blockbuster action, scify, fantasy, or even the occasional romcom on the big screen.<br><br>
                    Below are a few of my favorites.

                <h2 href="">Howard the Duck <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091225/" target="_blank">(IMDB)</a></h2>
                <p>
                    Howard burst on to the sceen with unrefined crassness that typified the 80's. Seemingly cute and lovable he was no Donald Duck. He smoked, drank, had a penchant for trouble and a thing for Lea Thompson (like most young men did).

                <h2>Windwalker <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081760/" target="_blank">(IMDB)</a></h2>  
                <p>
                    Windwalker told a moving tale of love and loss then reunion under the umbrela of pre-Colombian Native American life. This father comes back from the dead to help his family find peace.<br><br><br>

                    <h2>Krull <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085811/" target="_blank">(IMDB)</a></h2>
                    
              
                <p>
                    Krull caputures the mind with the heroic efforts of a prince rescuing his bride. Together with a few loyal friends and a physics defying spinning blade, he'll surely triumph over the alien invaders from another world.
