            <h1><strong><u>Internet Questions</u></strong></h1>
            <h5>by Evan Knight</h5>
            <h2>What is the difference between TCP/IP and HTML?</h2>
            <p>
                TCP/IP is the rules and protocol that govern how the internet transfers information from one device to another. HTML on the other hand determines how the content is displayed on a given device.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>What does URL mean?</h2>
            <p>
                URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. This essentially an address that directs your browser to the site you want to view. For the URL "www.google.com/news "www" indicates the site is located on the World Wide Web. ".google" is the domain, ".com" is the toplevel domain, and "/news" is a directory within the domain.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>What is the Client/Server model?</h2>
            <p>
                The client-server model describes how a server provides resources and services to one or more clients. These servers can provide resources to multiple client devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>What are two things browsers do?</h2>
            <p>
                Internet browsers do many things to help us navigate the information mega-highway, here are two examples:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Browswers send our URL requests to DNS(Domain Name System) Servers which finds the IP address for the corisponding site then directs the browser to that address.</li>
                <li>
                    Browsers trainslate the html, javascript, xml, ect... code into viewable images suited for the type of display being used.
                </li>
            </ul>
