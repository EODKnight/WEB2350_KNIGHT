                I am Evan, welcome to my page about me! Easily the subject I am most knowledgable about! I know more about me than any other person. Let me share a few things about me that I find most interesting!

                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p><img src="../images/Me-headshot1-BaW-cover-large.jpg" width="20%" id="imgFloatLeft"> This is me. I was born and raised in Ogden, Ut. I graduated from Weber High School in 1993. I had graduated with my certification as a Nurses Assistant and worked at Nursing Home for a year before I left for Mexico where I served a 2 year mission for my church. <br><br>
                After returning from Mexico I enrolled at Weber State Univerisity and began working at McKay-Dee Hospital as an Orderly and EKG Technician. I met my first wife at this time. We dated for a short time and after we married I joined the US Air Force with the intent of using the GI Bill to pay for medical school. Things didn't quite work out that way.

                <p>
                    <img src="../images/TL_Me.jpg" width="30%" id="imgFloatRight">When I went to enlist in the Air Force, I had intended to join one of the medical career fields. Unfortunately for me, they had filled more than their quota for that month. Not really having a back up plan, the recuiter started reading down the list of career fields that they were still trying to fill. When he read "Explosive Ordnance Disposal" I stopped him and asked what that was. He didn't know so he just read the canned description, but as he did, I imagined taking expired explosives out to a demolition range, then from a protected bunker blowing tons of bombs sky high!! I didn't even hesitate, I signed right there! Both my wife at the time and my mother were "less than pleased" with my impulsive decision. <br><br>
                    In the long list of decisions that changed the course of my life, this one has had the most effect on me. I became the consumate bad-ass that most people only see in movies. I was highly skilled and proficient in disarming everything from simple bombs to the most complex missiles; pipe bombs to terrorist devices, biological weapons and the most sophisticated nuclear ordnance ever built. I have lived adventures to fill several lifetimes, survided unspeakable horors, and endured the darkest depths of loss and hopelessness. I am grateful for my path through life, it has shaped me into who am. But, if I could alter one thing, I would have never have chosen EOD.

                <center><img src="../images/UsWeding.jpg" width="40%"></center><br>After some time in the Air Force, the stess of my job and frequent deployments, put too much strain on my mariage, and my first wife and I devorsed after being together for 9 years.  Thankfully we remain friends and have commited to co-parent our three kids equally and respectfully. I met my current wife not long after and a year later we married and have been together ever since. It's nice beating the odds of blending a family. But, my bestfriend and companion has been my anchor when I faced the darkest moments of my life. We have become a fantastic team, despite all the obstacles we have faced. I am a better person because of the encouragement and support she lovingly gives to our whole family.

                    I have since returned to Weber State, this time as a Computer Science Major. I have been learning code and writing programs since I was 9 years old. I continued my education taking computer science courses all through high school. But I couldn't see the future of software engineering, and persued other avenues. But I have a chance now to follow my passion. If I was ever good at what I did in the Air Force, it pales in comparison to what I am best at, computer science. Data structures, manupulating 1s an 0s, solving problems to make my code elegant and efficient is one of the ways I feel most fullfilled.

I have started my own tech company. Blue Sun Systems is a general service company that can service and repair computers and electronics and contracts with other firms to write code for thier projects.<br><br>
                    
                    My wife and I also sell and market health and wellness products that have helped me to regain a significant portion of my quality of life. I was pretty damaged after my time in the Air Force, mentaly, emotionally, and physically. I was in constant, intense pain, walked with a cane, and was a candidate for hip replacement surgury even at my young age. With the products I was introduced to I was able to stop taking the heavy narcotics I had been using for years and no longer required the use of a cane. I can walk for hours without any illeffects where I used to strugle walking more than 300ft. We have been very successful and on track to earn $100k in revenue from our first full year.
